# About Me

This page shares a few experiences that reflect my learning journey and hobbies.

---

## Learning Notes

I take **structured learning notes** to reinforce what I study. For example:

- **R, Python / Tableau & Data Analysis:** Notes on data wrangling, visualization, and modeling help me revisit concepts quickly during projects.  
- **Quarto & Web Development:** Step-by-step guides I created while learning website deployment and Git workflow are invaluable for reference.  

Keeping notes helps me **apply knowledge practically**, whether in coding projects or academic work.

## Hobbies & Interests

Outside of academics, I enjoy:

- **Traveling:** Experiencing Malaysia and Thailand, trying new cuisines, and finding inspiration in new environments.  
- **Movies & Music:** Watching anime from various genres and discovering new soundtracks.  

These hobbies keep me **creative and balanced**, often inspiring problem-solving and project ideas.
